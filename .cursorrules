# Cursor Rules for S3Proxy Helm Chart Project

## Project Structure
This is a Helm chart project for deploying S3Proxy to Kubernetes. The chart is located in `charts/s3proxy/`.

## Important File Handling Rules

### README.md Files - DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY
**CRITICAL:** The following README.md files are auto-generated and must NEVER be edited directly:
- `/README.md` (root project README)
- `/charts/s3proxy/README.md` (chart README, if it exists)

These files are generated from their corresponding template files using helm-docs.

**When asked to modify README content, you MUST:**
1. ONLY edit the template file: `charts/s3proxy/README.md.gotmpl`
2. NEVER directly edit any `README.md` files
3. Inform the user that README.md is auto-generated and changes should be made to the template
4. After editing the template, remind the user to regenerate README.md using helm-docs

**Template file location:**
- Template: `charts/s3proxy/README.md.gotmpl`
- Generated: `README.md` (root) - auto-generated from the template

## Helm Chart Best Practices
- Always validate YAML syntax when editing chart files
- Preserve the existing indentation style (spaces for YAML files as per YAML spec)
- When modifying values.yaml, ensure documentation comments are kept in sync
- Test template rendering with `helm template` after making changes
